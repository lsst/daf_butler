      observations are identified with an Exposure, but derived datasets
      that may be based on more than one Exposure (e.g. multiple snaps)
      are typically identified with Visits instead, even for cameras that
      don't have multiple Exposures per Visit.  As a result, Cameras that
      don't have multiple Exposures per Visit will typically have Visit
      entries that are essentially duplicates of their Exposure entries.

  SkyPix:
    doc: >
      A pixel in a hierarchical decomposition of the sky (e.g. HTM, Q3C, or
      HEALPix; we will select and support just one, but which is TBD). Has no
      SQL representation; even a definition table is not necessary, given that
      the allowable values and the associated spatial regions are best
      computed on-the-fly.  SkyPix units are preferred to SkyMap (i.e. Tract-
      Patch) units for Datasets without any overlap regions (e.g. sharded
      reference catalogs).

      There are also considerable advantages to standardizing on just one
      level of the standard pixelization: if all SkyPix values are at a single
      level, they can be indexed using standard B-Trees and compared with
      simple equality comparison.  In contrast, comparing SkyPix values at
      different levels requires pixelization- specific bit-shifting operations
      and custom indexes, which are much harder to implement across multiple
      RDMSs.  As a result, we will (at least initially) try to define just a
      single level for all SkyPix values.  Our preliminary guess is that this
      level should have pixels be approximately (within a factor of ~4) of the
      size of a single Sensor on the sky.
