    A special `Dimension` with no dependencies and a small number of rows,
    used to group the dimensions that depend on it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : `str`
        Name of the dimension.
    storage : `dict`
        Fully qualified name of the `GovernorDimensionRecordStorage` subclass
        that will back this element in the registry (in a "cls" key) along
        with any other construction keyword arguments (in other keys).
    metadata : `NamedValueAbstractSet` [ `ddl.FieldSpec` ]
        Field specifications for all non-key fields in this dimension's table.
    uniqueKeys : `NamedValueAbstractSet` [ `ddl.FieldSpec` ]
        Fields that can each be used to uniquely identify this dimension (given
        values for all required dimensions).  The first of these is used as
        (part of) this dimension's table's primary key, while others are used
        to define unique constraints.
    doc : `str`
        Extended description of this element.

    Notes
    -----
    Most dimensions have exactly one governor dimension as a required
    dependency, and queries that involve those dimensions are always expected
    to explicitly identify the governor dimension value(s), rather than
    retrieve all matches from the database.  Because governor values are thus
    almost always known at query-generation time, they can be used there to
    simplify queries, provide sensible defaults, or check in advance for common
    mistakes that might otherwise yield confusing (albeit formally correct)
    results instead of straightforward error messages.

    Governor dimensions may not be associated with any kind of topological
    extent.

    Governor dimension rows are often affiliated with a Python class or
    instance (e.g. `lsst.obs.base.Instrument`) that is capable of generating
    the rows of at least some dependent dimensions or providing other related
    functionality.  In the future, we hope to attach these instances to
    governor dimension records (instantiating them from information in the
    database row when it is fetched), and use those objects to add additional
    functionality to governor dimensions, but a number of (code) dependency
    relationships would need to be reordered first.
