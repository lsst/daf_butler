class DimensionElement(TopologicalRelationshipEndpoint):
    """A label and/or metadata in the dimensions system.

    A named data-organization concept that defines a label and/or metadata
    in the dimensions system.

    A `DimensionElement` instance typically corresponds to a _logical_ table in
    the `Registry`: either an actual database table or a way of generating rows
    on-the-fly that can similarly participate in queries.  The rows in that
    table are represented by instances of a `DimensionRecord` subclass.  Most
    `DimensionElement` instances are instances of its `Dimension` subclass,
    which is used for elements that can be used as data ID keys.

    Notes
    -----
    `DimensionElement` instances should always be constructed by and retrieved
    from a `DimensionUniverse`.  They are immutable after they are fully
    constructed, and should never be copied.

    Pickling a `DimensionElement` just records its name and universe;
    unpickling one actually just looks up the element via the singleton
    dictionary of all universes.  This allows pickle to be used to transfer
    elements between processes, but only when each process initializes its own
    instance of the same `DimensionUniverse`.
