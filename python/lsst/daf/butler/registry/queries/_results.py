        exact : `bool`, optional

        When using a very large result set to perform multiple queries (e.g.
        multiple calls to `subset` with different arguments, or even a single
        call to `expanded`), it may be much more efficient to start by
        materializing the query and only then performing the follow up queries.
        It may also be less efficient, depending on how well database engine's
        query optimizer can simplify those particular follow-up queries and
        how efficiently it caches query results even when the are not
        explicitly inserted into a temporary table.  See `expanded` and

        For very result sets, it may be much more efficient to call

            If `True` (`False` is default), the query should only return unique

            results via Python-side processing (which may be more efficient in
            some cases), use `toSet` to construct a `DataCoordinateSet` from
            this results object instead.

        Returns
        -------
        results : `DataCoordinateQueryResults`
            A results object corresponding to the given criteria.  May be
            ``self`` if it already qualifies.

        ValueError

            this result.

        Notes
        -----
        This method can only return a "near-subset" of the original result rows
        in general because of subtleties in how spatial overlaps are
        implemented; see `Query.projected` for more information.

        When calling `subset` multiple times on the same very large result set,
        it may be much more efficient to call `materialize` first.  For
        example::

            dimensions1 = DimensionGroup(...)
            dimensions2 = DimensionGroup(...)
            with registry.queryDataIds(...).materialize() as tempDataIds:
