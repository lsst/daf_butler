    New instances should be constructed by calling `initialize`, not by calling

    Notes
    -----
    This class (and the related methods in TableDimensionRecordStorage) can in
    principle manage overlaps between a database dimension element and any
    skypix dimension, but at present it is only being used to manage
    relationships with the special ``commonSkyPix`` dimension, because that's
    all the query system uses.  Eventually, we expect to require users to
    explicitly materialize more relationships.

    Other possible future improvements include:

     - allowing finer-grained skypix dimensions to provide overlap rows for
       coarser ones, by dividing indices by powers of 4 (and possibly doing
       ``SELECT DISTINCT`` in the subquery to remove duplicates);

     - allowing finer-grained database elements (e.g. patch) to provide overlap
       rows for coarser ones (e.g. tract), by ignoring irrelevant columns (e.g.
       the patch IDs) in the subquery (again, possible with ``SELECT
       DISTINCT``).

    But there's no point to doing any of that until the query system can figure
    out how best to ask for overlap rows when an exact match isn't available.
