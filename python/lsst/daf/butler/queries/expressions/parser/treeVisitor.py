    Visitors and tree node classes implement Visitor pattern for tree
    traversal. Typical use case is to generate different representation
    of the tree, e.g. transforming parsed tree into SQLAlchemy clause.

    All methods of the class can (and most likely should) return the
    "transformed" value of the visited node. This value will be returned
    from the `Node.visit` method and it will also be passed as an argument
    to other methods of the visitor.
