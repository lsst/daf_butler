    Parameters
    ----------
    source_datastore : `FileTransferSource`
        Object used to look up records.
    refs : `~collections.abc.Iterable` [ `DatasetRef` ]
        List of datasets to retrieve records for.

        Cache mapping datastore artifact to existence. Updated by

    ------
    files : `FileTransferMap`
        A dictionary from `DatasetId` to a list of `FileTransferRecord`,

    -----
    This will first attempt to look up records using the database, and then
    fall back to searching the filesystem if the transfer source is configured
    to do so.
