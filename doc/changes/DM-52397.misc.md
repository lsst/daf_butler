`Butler.registry.queryDatasets`, `Butler.registry.queryDataIds`, and `Butler.registry.queryDimensionRecords` have been re-implemented using the same query framework backing `Butler.query()` and the various `Butler.query_*()` methods.  Though the `Butler.registry.*` methods are not yet deprecated, users are encouraged to begin migrating to the equivalent `Butler.query_*` functions.  The new implementation comes with a number of minor behavior changes:
- We no longer raise an exception if governor dimension values in a query constraint are not known to the registry.  Instead, we return no results.
- Result rows are now deduplicated.
- `findFirst` searches are now supported in calibration collections.
