Make `ButlerLogRecords` extensible.

This changes the `ButlerLogRecords` file format (the old format can still be
read) to allow arbitrary JSON data to be serialized with the log records.

The `ButlerLogRecords` class has been modified to inherit from
`collections.abc.MutableSequence` instead of `pydantic.RootModel`, which means
Pydantic methods can no longer be called on it directly (in particular, use
`to_json_data` to serialize instead of `model_dump_json`).
