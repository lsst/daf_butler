Removed deprecated `DatasetQueryResults.materialize()` method.
Removed deprecated `offset` parameter from the `limit` method in the `DataCoordinateQueryResults`, `DatasetQueryResults`, and `DimensionRecordQueryResults` classes.
Removed the deprecated feature where HTM and HEALPix spatial dimensions like `htm11` or `healpix10` could be used in data ID constraints passed to queries. The exception is `htm7`, which will continue to work.  Users should instead use region `OVERLAPS` constraints in query `where` expressions.
Removed support for `<` and `>` operators in `Butler.registry.query*()` `where` strings for comparisons of `Timespan` vs `Timespan`, or `Timespan` vs `Time`.  Instead, use `timespan.begin < ts` or `timespan.end > ts` to explicitly indicate which timespan bound you are comparing with.
