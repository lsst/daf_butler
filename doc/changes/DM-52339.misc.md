Drop incomplete support for case-insensitive handling of identifiers in query expressions.

Some code in the query generation system was trying to allow dimension names to be case-insensitive, but was actually just inadvertently requiring all dimension names to be defined as lowercase.
Our Python-flavored user base probably expects case-sensitive dimension and dataset type names anyway.

Constants (e.g. `AND` or `OVERLAPS`) in the query system are still case insensitive.
