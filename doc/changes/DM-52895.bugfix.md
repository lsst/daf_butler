Change the conceptual timespan associated with `RUN` and `TAGGED` collections from `None` / `NULL` to an unbounded timespan.

This fixes the behavior of temporal joins in quantum graph builds, where prior to this change a `RUN` or `TAGGED` collection earlier in the search path would be silently ignored in favor of a later `CALIBRATION` collection.
It also changes the value of timespan columns for these collection types via the `Query.general` interface.
The behavior of `queryDatasetAssociations` has *not* been changed for backwards-compatibility; it continues to return `timespan=None` for non-`CALIBRATION` collections.
